# Project-Euler-Solutions

Project Euler (projecteuler.net) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the Project Euler questions. I have used Python 3.7.1 to write the solution programs.

This is a merely a list of solutions to whatever questions I have solved, as such there will be problems for which there won't be an answer in this repo, as well as they often won't be the most optimum solutions. If you wish to get the answers to all questions, [luckytoilet's repository offers them](https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions). For getting more detailed solutions, they are available on Project Euler's website.
